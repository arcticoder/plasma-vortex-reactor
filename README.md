Plasma Vortex Reactor
=====================

A research and prototyping repository for a plasma vortex reactor targeting high-energy applications (e.g., antiproton production) via pair creation in controlled plasma vortices. This repo integrates vortex dynamics, kinetic modeling, confinement equilibria, and EM/laser-plasma coupling. It links to the broader arcticoder ecosystem for simulation, energy sourcing, and control.

- docs/: roadmap.ndjson, progress_log.ndjson, UQ-TODO.ndjson, VnV-TODO.ndjson
- src/: reactor package with light, testable stubs for math kernels and control glue
- tests/: pytest/unittest-style sanity and smoke tests
